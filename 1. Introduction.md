MongoDb came from the word Humongous. Because it can store lots of data.

Here You can create many databse as you want on mongodb server. Table is replaced by Collection. And Each data is represented as ddocument for that collection. Here you can store docs in any format this is the flexibility provided by MongoDb And you can say the main feature of MongoDb. Its not needed any schema(Schemaless). But working with application we need some schema.

Data store in MongoDb as an object. object is Datastructure in javascript having key and value pair. We can also store nested data in their, which is also main feature of mongoDb. Because this allow us to create a complex relation between data and store in one document. which makes working with it and fetching data super efficiently. Where is SQL we have to write complex join to fetch data from two different table. We can also store list of other datatype inside the doc. Behind the scene MongoDB convert JSON(Javascript Object Notation) into BSON (Binary Script Object Notation) to do operation efficinetly and we don't have to worry about that.

So the whole theme for mongodb is Flexibilitya and Optimizayion for Usability. And it makes mongodb different from other Databse Solution.


MongoDb is also called NoSQL databse because the the concept or philoshphy is just opposite to SQL database. Istead of normalizing data(storing data on distributed table, wheer every table have clear schema and using complex relation). MongoDb goes for storing data together in a document.

And it also doesn't enforce any schema on document. If we have multiple docuemt in one of the same collection, They can have different structure. This can lead us to messy data but Its our responsibilty as developer to work with clean data implement the solution to work with that.

You can use mongodb for apps that might still evolve, where the exact data requirements are just not set yet, you can get started and you can always add data with more information in a collection in the same collection
at a later point of time. You also work with less relations, there are some relations and I have old module where I talk about that
but with these embedded documents which I already showed you, one core thing of mongodb indeed is that you have less tables, so less collections which you connect but instead that you store data together and this is where the efficiency is derived from. Since data is stored together, when your application is fetching data, it doesn't need to reach out to collection A, merge it with
collection B, merge it with collection C, instead it goes to collection A then mongodb has a very efficient querying mechanism behind the scenes so that it can go through all the data very fast when looking for
a specific document, so this will be super fast and then it finds that document and it's done, it doesn't need to do any merging most of the time. So this is really where the speed, the performance and flexibility comes from and this hopefully speaks for itself that this can be useful when building applications and this is also why noSQL solutions and amongst them most of all mongodb, is super popular for read write heavy applications, applications with a lot of workload, applications that store a lot
of data, let's say smart devices which send some sensor data every second, for such applications but also for building an online shop or a blog, mongodb is an amazing
solution due to the performance and the flexibility it gives you.
